<h1>Contract Automata App</h1>

This is the GUI application of CAT, and represents an example of usage of the CAT API.
The contract automata API has been imported as a Jar, under the folder library (check  https://github.com/davidebasile/ContractAutomataTool).
The App allows to visualize the automata, edit them, and use the main operations.

The main application is in the file App.java, under com.mxgraph.examples.swing.editor package. 
A precompiled App.jar file is available in the root of the project.
The application is based on an existing framework called *mxGraph* for
editing graphs in Java. 
The GUI is implemented starting from the BasicGraphEditor available 
in mxGraph.
The other classes are also modifications of the BasicGraphEditor example 
of mxGraph. 
For more info check https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/docs/manual_javavis.html.

The App has been developed using Eclipse and tested on Windows machines.

<h2>Tutorials</h2>

A first video tutorial is available at https://youtu.be/LAzCEQtYOhU and it shows the usage of the tool for composing automata and compute orchestrations of product lines, using the examples published in JSCP2020.
The directory demoJSCP contains an executable jar and the models used in this tutorial.

The second video tutorial, available at https://youtu.be/W0BHlgQEhIk, shows the computation of orchestrations and choreographies for the examples published in LMCS2020.
The directory demoLMCS2020 contains an executable jar and the models used in this tutorial.

The third video tutorial, available at https://youtu.be/QJjT7f7vlZ4, shows the recent refactoring and improvements of the tool published in Coordination2021.
