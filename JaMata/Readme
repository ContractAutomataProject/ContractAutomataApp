FMCA Tool is built on top of JaMaTa,  an earlier prototypical tool for managing different automata models. 
The tool is still prototypical and under development. 
At the actual stage, it has been mainly used by the authors for developing the theory 
regarding FMCA, MSCA and CA. 
We are working  on improving its usability for potential users.

FMCAT features both a GUI (based on mxGraph) and a command line interface. 
The two applications are available under the folder JaMaTa/src.

The Hotel Reservation Scenario FMCAs are under the folder FMCAexamples/HotelReservationSystem.
