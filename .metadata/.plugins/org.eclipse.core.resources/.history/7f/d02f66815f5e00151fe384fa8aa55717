JaMaTa is a tool that manages different automata models. 
The full documentation is under the folder JaMaTA/doc.

The base package is FSA (Finite State Automata). 
These classes are extended for representing
	- CA (Contract Automata)
	- FMA (Finite Memory Automata)
	- PFSA (Push-down Nominal Automata)
	
The early version of the tool was realized for checking membership in FMA,PFSA and FSA.

Later the Contract Automata model was added for implementing the verification techniques
that have been developed by the authors in

CA
In the workspace it is possible to load the "2 buyers protocol" example, more informations
are available on the file 2BP.



FMA - PFSA - FSA
In the workspace there are different automaton to load:
	- FMAexample1       it is the first example presented in the paper "Finite Memory Automata". This automaton recognize 
						strings where a character appears at least two times. An example of a string recognized by the 
						automaton is "123145".
	- FSAexample		a simple FSA that recognize the strings "12" and "123"
	- PFSAaut3			a PFSA automaton that recognize strings representing balanced parenthesis. An example 
						of a string recognized is: "12234431"

There are other PFSA example used for testing the software.
