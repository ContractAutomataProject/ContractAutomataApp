	- B1 the buyer 1
	- B2 the buyer 2
	- S the seller
	- B1xB2xS  	the product computed by the tool
	- KS(B1xB2xS) the most permissive controller for strong agreement computed by the tool
				  this CA has mixed choice states and does not enjoy branching condition
				  
there are also modified versions called B1R,B2R,SR , B1R',B2R',SR'  where
	-  KS(B1RxB2RxSR) does not enjoys branching condition and has mixed choice states
	-  KS(B1RxB2RxSR') enjoys branching condition and has mixed choice states
	-  KS(B1R'xB2R'xSR') enjoys branching condition and has no mixed choice states
